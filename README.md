ITCAutoingest is a gem for gathering reports out of iTunes connect. It uses the ITC autoingest service to download and parse the reports and **does not** try to scrape the iTunes connect website.

For more information about ITC reports see this [pdf](http://www.apple.com/itunesnews/docs/AppStoreReportingInstructions.pdf).

## Features

* Supports Sales reports, Daily/Weekly reports and Summary/Opt-in reports (see above pdf for more information on each type of report)
* Returns report as a hash of the information in the downloaded report file
* Handy command line tool that can be used to output tab delimited information or as an example of how to use the gem

## Instructions

The command line tool uses the following syntax:

``` text
itc_autoingest <username> <password> <vendorid> <report type> <date type> <report subtype> <date>
```
* username - your itunes connect username
* password - your itunes connect password
* vendorid - your itunes connect vendor id
* report type - there are two report types supported: Sales & Preorder
* date type - there are two date types supported: Daily and Weekly
* report subtype - there are three subtypes supported: Summary, Detailed and Opt-In
* date - the timeframe for the report in yyyymmdd format

The gem has the following methods available:

* daily_sales_summary_report(reportdate)
* weekly_sales_summary_report(reportdate)
* daily_sales_detailed_report(reportdate)
* weekly_sales_detailed_report(reportdate)
* daily_preorder_summary_report(reportdate)
* weekly_preorder_summary_report(reportdate)
* daily_sales_optin_report(reportdate)
* weekly_sales_optin_report(reportdate)

A hash is returned from each of these calls and will contain a report item with an array of hashed report data or an error item that contains an error from the reporting system.

## Examples

Using the command line utility will look something like this:

``` text
itc_autoingest user pass 50050992 Sales Daily Summary 20110901
```

The following example would result in **report** being filled with a hash of report data for the given date:

``` rb
require "itc_autoingest"

itca = ITCAutoingest::ITCAutoingest.new(username, password, vendorid)
report = itca.daily_sales_summary_report('20110901')

puts report
```
